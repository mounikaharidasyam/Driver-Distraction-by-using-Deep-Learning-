#Driver-Distraction-by-using-Deep-Learning-
Driving a car is a complex task, and it requires complete attention.Distracted driving is any activity that takes away the driver’s 
attention from the road.Several studies have identified three main types of distraction: visual distractions (driver’s eyes off the road), 
manual distractions (driver’s hands off the wheel) and cognitive distractions (driver’s mind off the driving task).
