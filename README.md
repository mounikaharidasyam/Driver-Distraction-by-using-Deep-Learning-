#Driver-Distraction-by-using-Deep-Learning-
Driving a car is a complex task, and it requires complete attention.Distracted driving is any activity that takes away the driver’s 
attention from the road.Several studies have identified three main types of distraction: visual distractions (driver’s eyes off the road), 
manual distractions (driver’s hands off the wheel) and cognitive distractions (driver’s mind off the driving task).
We took the StateFarm dataset which contained snapshots from a video captured by a camera mounted in the car. 
The training set has ~22.4 K labeled samples with equal distribution among the classes and 79.7 K unlabeled test samples.
